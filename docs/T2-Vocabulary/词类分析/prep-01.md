# Prepositions 1

> Purpose of this note:
> 
> - Build a **global view (map)** of English prepositions
>     
> - Establish the link: **core meaning → extended meaning → IELTS usage**
>     
> - Serve as a navigation index for later detailed studies
>     

## 1. Three Semantic Dimensions of Prepositions

### 1.1 Space (Spatial Relations)

> The origin of almost all prepositional meanings

Core spatial prepositions:

- in (inside, enclosed)
    
- on (surface, contact)
    
- at (point, exact location)
    
- under / over
    
- above / below
    
- between / among
    
- behind / in front of
    

Key idea:

> Abstract meanings are metaphorical extensions of spatial meanings.

### 1.2 Time (Temporal Relations)

High-frequency temporal prepositions:

- at → point in time
    
- on → specific day/date
    
- in → longer period
    
- during
    
- before / after
    
- until
    

IELTS relevance:

- Task 1 (processes, trends)
    
- Listening (time references)

### 1.3 Abstract Relations (Non-physical)

This is the **core battlefield of IELTS Writing Task 2**.

Major abstract categories:

- Cause / reason → because of, due to, owing to
    
- Purpose → for
    
- Possession / relation → of
    
- Reference / topic → about, regarding
    
- Method / means → by, with
    
- Standard / perspective → in terms of
    

## 2. High-Frequency IELTS Prepositions (Priority Map)

### 2.1 Tier 1 – Absolute Core

> These must be mastered in depth.

- in
    
- on
    
- at
    
- for
    
- to
    
- of
    

Characteristics:

- Extremely frequent
    
- Strong L1 (Chinese) interference
    
- Small errors cause clear score loss
    

### 2.2 Tier 2 – Writing & Reading Core

- by
    
- with
    
- about
    
- between / among
    
- during
    
- before / after
    

Characteristics:

- Often appear in explanations and comparisons
    
- Frequently tested indirectly in reading comprehension
    

### 2.3 Tier 3 – Academic / Formal Expressions

Mostly multi-word prepositions:

- due to
    
- because of
    
- according to
    
- regarding
    
- in terms of
    
- as a result of
    

Usage:

- Highly common in Task 2
    
- Add academic tone when used correctly
    

## 3. Prepositions vs Other Word Classes (Boundary Awareness)

### 3.1 Preposition vs Conjunction

Key diagnostic question:

> Does it take a **clause** or a **noun phrase**?

Examples:

- because (conjunction) vs because of (preposition)
    
- although (conjunction) vs despite (preposition)
    
- while (conjunction) vs during (preposition)
    

### 3.2 Preposition vs Adverb

Criterion:

> A preposition **must have an object**.

Common confusing pairs:

- before / after
    
- above / below
    
- inside / outside
    

## 4. Common Prepositional Structures in IELTS Writing

These function as **ready-made logical modules**:

- in terms of + noun
    
- with regard to + noun
    
- at the expense of + noun
    
- as a result of + noun
    
- by means of + noun
    
- in comparison with + noun
    

Tip:

> Treat them as single units, not word-by-word combinations.

## 5. Typical IELTS Error Zones (Overview)

High-risk areas for Chinese learners:

- in / on / at (space & time)
    
- for vs to (purpose vs direction)
    
- of overuse or misuse
    
- incorrect noun–preposition pairing
    

## 6. How to Use This Map

- Do NOT memorize sentences here
    
- Use it as:
    
    - a classification system
        
    - a navigation index
