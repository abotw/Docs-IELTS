> 
> - Establish a **clear contrast system** for in / on / at

## 1. Core Spatial Meanings (Mother Meanings)

### in – enclosure / inside

- inside a boundary
    
- three-dimensional space
    

Examples:

- in a room
    
- in a box
    
- in a city
    

Mental image:

> something is **contained within** a space

---

### on – surface / contact

- touching a surface
    
- two-dimensional contact
    

Examples:

- on the table
    
- on the wall
    
- on the floor
    

Mental image:

> something is **supported by or attached to** a surface

---

### at – point / exact location

- a specific point
    
- no emphasis on size or boundary
    

Examples:

- at the door
    
- at the bus stop

Mental image:

## 2. Spatial Contrast (IELTS High-frequency)

Compare:

- The students are **in** the classroom.  
    (inside the space)
    
- The students are **at** the classroom.  
    (location, not internal focus)
    

Compare:

- The picture is **on** the wall.  
    (surface contact)
    
- The picture is **in** the wall.  
    (embedded)
    

Key rule:

> Choose the preposition based on **how you conceptualize the scene**, not the noun itself.

## 3. Time Meanings (Derived from Space)

### at – precise time point

- at 8 o'clock
    
- at noon
    
- at the beginning
    

### on – specific day or date

- on Monday
    
- on 1 May
    
- on that day
    

### in – longer period

- in 2025
    
- in the 21st century
    
- in the long term
    

IELTS tip:

> Time usage is highly standardized — errors are noticeable and costly.

## 5. High-risk Confusion Zones (IELTS Traps)

- at the end → position in time or space
    

---

### 5.2 in time vs on time

- on time → punctual
    

---

### 5.3 at work vs in work

## 7. Decision Guide (Quick Check)

Ask yourself:

1. Am I describing a space, a time, or an abstract state?
    
2. Is it an enclosure (in), a surface/support (on), or a point (at)?
    
3. Am I using a fixed IELTS expression?
