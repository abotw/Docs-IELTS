## 🗣️ 如果考官继续追问（提前准备）

### Q: _Do you like living there?_

> Yes, I do. It’s more independent, and the environment is much quieter than a dormitory.

### Q: _Which do you prefer, a flat or a dormitory?_

> I prefer living in a flat because it offers more privacy and freedom.

### Q: _Would you like to live there in the future?_

> Probably not long-term. After graduation, I’d like to move to a different city for further study.
