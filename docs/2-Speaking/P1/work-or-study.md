# Work or Study

In IELTS Speaking Part 1, this is a **very common opening question**, and examiners expect a **clear, natural, present-tense answer**. Here are **safe, high-scoring templates** you can adapt.

---

## 1️⃣ If you are a student (most common)

**Simple & natural**

> _I’m currently a university student. I’m majoring in computer science._

- a X student
	- university
	- full-time
- major in
- computer science

**Slightly expanded (Band 7+)**

> _I’m currently studying computer science at university. I’m in my final year, so I’m quite busy with coursework and projects._

- at university
- be in my X year
	- first
	- second
	- final

**If you want to sound more fluent**

> _At the moment, I’m a full-time student, majoring in computer science. I’m especially interested in operating systems and software development._

- be interested in
- OS: operating systems

---

## 2️⃣ If you are working

**Simple**

> _I’m currently working as a software developer._

- currently
- work as

**Expanded**

> _I work as a software developer for a small tech company, and I mainly focus on backend development._

- tech company

---

## 3️⃣ If you are BOTH studying and working (very common)

> _I’m currently a full-time student, but I also do some part-time work alongside my studies._

- do X work

Or:

> _I’m studying at university, and at the same time I’m doing a part-time job to gain some practical experience._

- do X job

---

## 4️⃣ If you are not working or studying right now (be honest, but positive)

> _At the moment, I’m not working or studying. I’ve just finished my degree, and I’m preparing for the IELTS exam and looking for job opportunities._

This is **completely acceptable** in IELTS.

## ⚠️ Common mistakes to avoid

❌ _I study computer science now_  
❌ _I am learning in university_  
❌ Very long life stories

✔ Use **present continuous** or **present simple**  
✔ 1–2 sentences is perfect  
✔ Sound relaxed, not memorized

---

## 🎯 Examiner’s expectation (important)

This question is:

- **NOT a test of ideas**
    
- **Just a warm-up**
    
- Mainly checking your **fluency and tense accuracy**
